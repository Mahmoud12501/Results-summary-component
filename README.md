## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This repository contains my solution for the Frontend Mentor " Results Summary Component" challenge. The challenge involved creating a responsive and visually appealing  Results Summary Component using HTML and CSS.

## Key Features:
- Responsive layout: The order summary component is designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
- Semantic HTML structure: I followed best practices for structuring HTML elements, ensuring accessibility and search engine optimization.
- CSS styling: I used CSS to style the component, focusing on visual elements such as colors, typography, and spacing.
- Flexbox/Grid: I utilized Flexbox or CSS Grid to create a responsive and flexible layout for the component.
- Cross-browser compatibility: The code has been tested across major web browsers to ensure consistent rendering and functionality.

 In addition to the key features you mentioned, you also utilized a linear gradient for the background of the Results Summary Component. This means that you incorporated CSS code to create a gradient effect, where the background transitions from one color to another in a linear manner.

Using a linear gradient for the background can add visual interest and depth to the component. By carefully selecting the colors and direction of the gradient, you can enhance the overall aesthetic appeal and make the component more visually engaging.

Feel free to explore the code and the implementation to gain insights into how I approached the challenge and how I organized my HTML and CSS files.
